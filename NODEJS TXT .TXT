  ** Asynchronous amd Synchronous 

  ** Synchronous :- In Synchronous operation tasks are performed one at a time 
       [ USER ] [ PRODUCT ] [ CITIES ]

       So, here first performed in USER all tasks then moved on second tasks


  ** Asynchronous :- In Asynchronous operation, second tasks not wait to finish first tasks

       [ USER ]
        [ PRODUCT ]
         [ CITIES ]

       So, here performed all task at a time and jisme sabse kam data hoga uska output sabse pahile 
         show krega
